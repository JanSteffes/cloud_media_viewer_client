# Cloud Media Viewer - Client

A project in development. As the name indicated - a client to show pictures/videos comming from cloud storages like OneDrive, Google Drive or Mega.
First goal is to integrate OneDrive.

## Getting Started

This is the client project to show the media.
The main part (connecting to the cloud storages, requesting media, ...) is done in another project, see [Cloud Media Viewer Backend](https://github.com/JanSteffes/CloudMediaViewerBackend).
