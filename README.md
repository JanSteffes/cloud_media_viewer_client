# Cloud Media Viewer - Client

A project in development. As the name indicated - a client to show pictures/videos comming from cloud storages like OneDrive, Google Drive or Mega.
First goal is to integrate OneDrive.

## Getting Started

This is the client project to show the media.
The main part (connecting to the cloud storages, requesting media, ...) is done in another project, see TODO, which is an ASP .Net Backend.
